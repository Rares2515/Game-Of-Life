Game of Life - C Project


Author: Chiculita Rares-Andrei
Project made as a university assignment.


Description
-This program is a version of the Game of Life. The program simulates the evolution of cells on a board and includes:


Classic Game of Life rules
-Binary tree of generations
-Stack with changes between generations
-Graph of live cells and search for the longest path


Functionalities
-Evolution of cells over multiple generations
-Storing changes using a stack
-Building a binary tree with different rules on left and right
-Representing live cells in a graph
-Searching for the longest Hamiltonian path

Used Structures
-Change: modification (row, column)
-Node: stack
-Node_tree: binary tree
-Graph: graph with live cells
-Coord: cell coordinates

Compilation
-Compiled with: bash

Notes
-Live cells are marked with X
-Dead cells are marked with +
-The program works with matrices, stacks, and graphs
